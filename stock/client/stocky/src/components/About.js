          <p className=" text-center px-5">
            Online stock market games are simple, easy-to-use programs that
            imitate the real-life workings of the equities markets. Most stock
            market games give users $100,000 in pretend money to start. From
            there, players pick to purchase; most of the stocks are those that
            are available on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq and the
            American Stock Exchange (AMEX).
          </p>
          <p className="text-center px-5">
            Most online stock simulators try to match real-life circumstances
            and actual performance as much as possible. Many even charge broker
            fees and commissions. These charges can significantly affect an
            investor's bottom line, and including these in simulated trading
            helps users learn to factor these costs in when making purchasing
            decisions. Along the way, theyâ€™ll also learn the basics of finance
            and learn the basic terminology of investing, such as momentum
            trading, shorts and P/E ratios.

          <hr className="col-1"></hr>
          <p className="text-center px-5">
            These useful skills can be applied to an actual trading account. Of
            course, in the real world, there are numerous factors that affect
            trading and investment decisions, such as one's risk tolerance,
            investment horizon, investment objectives, taxation issues, need for
            diversification, and so on. It is impossible to take investor
            psychology into account because actual hard cash is not at risk.

          <p className="text-center px-5">
            Also, while the Investopedia Stock Simulator comes close to
            replicating the real-life experience of trading, it does not
            currently offer a real-time trading environment with live prices.
            However, for most users, the 15-minute lag in trade execution will
            not be an impairment to their learning experience.
